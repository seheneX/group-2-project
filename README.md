# # Overview

This project is a responsive Results Summary Component built using HTML and CSS. It presents a user’s test results in a clean, modern card layout that highlights performance categories such as Reaction, Memory, Verbal, and Visual.

The design is inspired by a Frontend Mentor challenge and was collaboratively developed by Group 2 as a hands-on front-end project.
